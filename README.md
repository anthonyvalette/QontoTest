Include a README.md with the following

model objects like User or Album are all in the model package
Tasks for launching web requests and retrofit interfaces are in the network package
in the ui package we get the mainActivity and all the fragments, we here use one Activity and several fragments for a better user navigation and in case we have to do a pad app (we could display list of users and list of album in the same screen in 2 different fragment)
all fragments are separated into the fragment, its state and its views.

I used retrofit library for web request because its easy to use with customisable url
I used the RecyclerView widget because it's more efficient than ListView and it's impose the viewHloder Pattern
What was the most difficult part of the challenge?
the retrofit and web request because I started to used it about one week ago (used Volley before)
